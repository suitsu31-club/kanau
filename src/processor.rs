/// # Processor
///
/// A Processor is one of the fundamental building blocks in kanau.
/// In essence, a Processor is a durable async operation handler - think of it as a persistent
/// async function with dependencies bundled in.
///
/// While Rustâ€™s async closures are still unstable, a Processor achieves similar functionality
/// through a trait-based approach. It encapsulates both state (dependencies) and behavior
/// (the processing logic) in a single abstraction.
pub trait Processor<I, O> {
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    fn process<'a>(&'a self, input: I) -> impl Future<Output = O> + Send + 'a where I: 'a;

    }

/// ## FinalProcessor
///
/// A variant of processor to solve lifetime issues.
///
/// The key difference is that [FinalProcessor] takes an `Arc<Self>` as state, not `&Self`,
/// ensuring the processor outlives the `Future` it returns. This is particularly useful in
/// cases where the future needs to live independently of the original context, such as
/// when it's spawned into a new task.

///
/// A variant of processor that receive a borrowed reference as an argument.
///
/// This is useful when the input is a reference that needs to be borrowed for the duration
/// of the processing.

/// 
/// ## Returns
/// 
/// A stream of output items. The order of the output items is *not guaranteed to be the same* as the input items.
